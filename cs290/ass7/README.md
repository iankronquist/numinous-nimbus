# Note on this project

I decided to use Python and Flask instead of NodeJS and Express for this project since the assignment didn't say I couldn't. I just thought it would be good to practice with other frameworks.

For dependencies instead of a package.json there is a requirements.txt file.

To install dependencies run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
