This assignment was relatively simple and straightforward. I did find Cross Origin Resource sharing somewhat complex but after rereading that section it made sense. Compared to my work in the last How-To assignment, using the \texttt{requests} library to make server side requests was absolutely trivial. In that assignment I initially had difficulty authenticating with the Dropbox API and keeping straight all three of its API keys.

The \texttt{express-session} package made session management a total breeze. In the past I have worked with PHP sites which require arcane magic incantations to extract data from cookies, and Python sites with complicated authentication libraries which tried and failed to abstract away and hide the cookies from the developer. I will definitely consider using it any time I need to do session management with a nodejs website.
